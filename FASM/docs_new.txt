     mov  eax,'ABCD'
    and
     mov  eax,"ABCD"
 3. updated a few grammar items and spellings.


6 July 2006:
 1. You can now include a binary file at a given point in your object file.

   mov  ax,1234h

  incbin this_file.bin

   mov  ax,4321h

  will include the contents of "this_file.bin" at that location in the
  object file.


23 Sept 2005:
 1. NBASM now allows floating point declarations using three prefix characters.
    '!' for 4-byte floats
    '#' for 8-byte doubles
    '@' for 10-byte declares

    ex:
       float   dd  !1234.5678
       double  dq  #1234.5678
       large   dt  @1234.5678

 2. NBASM now has a cross reference feature.

  NBASM includes a cross reference feature.  A cross reference is
   a list of each symbol and then a list of each line it is used on.

  This allows you to find where a symbol is used.

  Here is an example of a cross reference for the following source
   file:

    .model tiny
    .code
    .186
    
    TEMP equ 1234h
    
           org 100h
    
           mov  ax,TEMP
    
           mov  dx,offset printme
           mov  ah,09
           int  21h
    
           .exit
    
    printme db 13,10,'An example$'
    
    .end
    
     ------------------------------------------------
       Symbol Table Dump with Cross Reference List:  
     ------------------------------------------------
    
      Symbol          (equ)    Value  XRef List
    
    _NBASM_              *  1
    TEMP                 *  1234H
    PRINTME                     10Eh  17, 11
    

  The cross reference displays eht value of the symbol plus
   each line that it was used on.  If there is no line numbers
   in the XRef List, then that symbol was not used in the source.

  ***** Obviously, the TEMP symbol was used, and there are
        no numbers in the XREF list.  This is a known error
        and I hope to have it fixed soon.

  The cross reference is created in the listing file when you
   use the /x command line parameter.
