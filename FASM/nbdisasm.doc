    use. If you use this package for commercial use, please contact me for
    special terms and conditions.

 6. Sorry for all the legalities.  This is to protect me as well as protect 
    you.


What is NBDISASM indented for?

 1. NBDISASM is indented for users that want to learn assembly language as
    well as experienced users who want to create assembly language projects.

 2. NBDISASM can be used to disassemble small or large projects.  There are
    no size restrictions, other than available memory.

 3. I created NBDISASM mostly for the enjoyment and to learn how to create a 
    disassembler.  You may use NBDISASM to its full capabilities, but please
    take note that it does contain bugs and/or errors.  If you find a bug
    and/or error, please let me know. I am constantly adding new things to
    NBASM and fixing bugs and errors is part of the fun.

-=-=-=- NewBasic Disassembler -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Page 03

What can NBDISASM do?

 1. NBDISASM takes a binary file, consisting of Intel compatible instructions,
    aka machine code language for the 8086/88 through the Pentium processors,
    and outputs to the standard out, the screen, a list of mnemonics.  In
    other words, it dis-assembles a given assembled program.

 2. Your binary files are not restricted and can be of any size, as long as
    there is enough available memory.

 3. NBDISASM supports long filenames, and uses long filenames by default if
    the current operating system has LFN support.

 4. NBDISASM is 'fairly' fast.  The source to NBDISASM is in C and compiled
    with the 32-bit DJGPP.  You can get DJGPP from http://www.delorie.com/djgpp.

 5. NBDISASM is easy to use.


What won't NBDISASM do?

 1. NBDISASM afterall is a disassembler and can be used to reverse engineer
    other peoples code.  However, please take into account that this may
    or may not be legal depending on what you use NBDISASM for.  I take
    no responsibility, legal or other, if you are using NBDISASM illegaly.

Difference Between Other Disassemblers

  NBDISASM is very close to NASM's NDISASM.  There are just a few
  differences.  With a little work, I am sure I could get it to be
  just like NDISASM, but why :-)


Conflicts with Other Software

 1. MCAFEE in a Win9x DOS session
    MCAFEE's VSCAN for Windoze 9x makes NBDISASM pause just after the
    Copyright information that is printed to the screen.  It is probably
    scanning the source file for viruses before it reads from to disk.  To
    stop the 'pause', right click the 'V' (VirusScan) icon in the task bar
    and click on EXIT.
    Once you finish your DOS session, you can reload VirusScan.  
    If you don't get the 'pause', then there is no need to unload VirusScan.

    NBDISASM does not contain any intentional viruses.  However, it is always
    safe to scan all files you get from the internet or any type of disk.

  
  No other known conflicts.  Please let me know if you find one.



System Requirements
 1. Intel compatible 386+ machine with a "proper" DPMI server.
    The following items are valid DPMI servers:
      MS Windows Dos box, QDPMI, 386Max, NWDOS, OpenDOS, OS/2,
      Linux DOSEmu, and DJGPP's CWSDPMI.
    You can get 'CWSDPMI - DPMI server' from:
      ftp://ftp.bu.edu/pub/mirrors/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2misc/csdpmi5b.zip
        or 
      ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2misc/csdpmi5b.zip
 2. a disk drive with a minimum of 256k of free disk space
    (is that all?) plus room for the output files file(s).
 3. The memory requirements are the size of the file you disassemble.
 4. a keyboard   ( Duuhh! =:o) )
 5. a printer capable of text printing (for hard-copies right?)


Software Requirements
 1. A DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) server:
      Windows DOS box, QDPMI, 386Max, NWDOS, OpenDOS, OS/2, Linux DOSEmu,
       or DJGPP's CWSDPMI.
 2. Some sort of viewer to view this document.  (But you are reading this
    right now, so you got at least that much, right?)
 4. PKUNZIP/WINZIP to unzip the zip file.  Again, you are reading this file,
    so you must have one of these :0)

Bug Report
  NBDISASM is not perfect and there are bound to be bugs in it.
   Please report bugs to:

    fys@fysnet.net

Known Bugs/Errors
  This is the first release, so I am sure there are bugs.


Mailing List
  I have an announcement mailing-list which I use to announce news and updates 
  about NBASM and other items pertaining to NBASM.  It is a moderated list and 
  will only be used for NBASM announcements.

  If you would like to receive mail each time I make an update or announce 
  something about NBASM, please send an empty email message to:

    nbasm-subscribe@yahoogroups.com

  To unsubscribe from the list, please send an empty email message to:

  If you have any problems with the above mailing list, please let me know at:

    fys@fysnet.net  (Please include your Yahoogroups login in name)

  
  I don't plan on more than about a single message per week at the most.  So 
    don't worry about me filling your "inbox"  :-)

Using NBDISASM

Running NBDISASM

  From the DOS prompt, type:  (Items in brackets are optional.)

    NBDISASM source.ext [parameter list]

    source.ext is the filename of your source file.  You must include the 
      extension.
    parameter list can be any one of the following in any order.
      Please note that any parameters are first come, first serve and will
      overwrite any parameters previously listed on the command line.
      (the '-' char can be substituted for the '/' char)
              ** All parameters are case sensitive **

      /b    - disassemble 16-bit code
      /B    - disassemble 32-bit code
      /o    - origin.  The starting offset of the code.
              You must give a C style Hex number.
              examples:
                /o0x100
                /o0x12345678
      /e    - skip.  Skip so many bytes from the front of the file.
              You must give a C style Hex number.
              examples:
                /e0x100
                /e0x12345678
      /n    - no hex.  Don't display the hex code.
      /N    - no offset.  Don't display the offset column.
      /v    - view version info

  NBDISASM returns an error code in ERRORLEVEL for use in .bat files.  The 
  following codes are returned:

    00h     - No error encountered

    *** I have not included the detailed error codes yet. ***
