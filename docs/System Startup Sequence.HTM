 When you turn your computer on, it runs through some built-in diagnostic

 tests (called the POST or <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0264.HTM">Power-On Self-Test</a>).  If it detects a problem

 during these tests, you may see an error code (see <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0265.HTM">POST Error Codes</a>) or

 perhaps a full-screen interactive configuration utility will appear (this

 varies from machine to machine, depending on the brand of computer you

 have and the maker of its ROM-BIOS).



 After the POST, but before booting the disk, the ROM-BIOS performs

 <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0266.HTM">ROM-Scan</a> to see if any hardware adaptors have installed ROM into the

 areas between c000:0 and e000:0.



 Once the system gets past the POST and ROM-Scan, the sequence is basically

 the same for all IBM-compatible computers.  The following steps occur

 after the POST or whenever you press Ctrl+Alt+Del to reboot:



   1) If a diskette is in drive A, the boot sector of that drive is read

      and the system attempts to boot using system files from the diskette.

      If it is not a system disk, a message such as...



           Non-System disk or disk error

           Replace and press any key when ready



      ...appears.  You can do as it requests, or just press any key to boot

      from your hard disk.



      If no diskette is in drive A, the system attempts to boot from your

      first hard disk (always drive C).  The <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/NOTHERE.HTM">Master Boot Record</a> (MBR)

      of the hard disk is read into memory and executed.



      The program code in MBR looks at the <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/NOTHERE.HTM">disk partition table</a> (also in

      the MBR) and determines which operating system to start.  For most of

      us, the hard disk contains a single operating system -- MS-DOS 6 (you

      may use Fdisk to activate a different operating system).  The first

      sector of the active partition is used as the boot sector for that

      operating system.  From here on, the boot sequence is the same for

      hard disks and diskettes.



   2) The boot sector is read into memory and executed.  It contains

      instructions to look for two files in the root of the startup disk.



      IO.SYS contains the standard device drivers along with code that

      processes the rest of the boot sequence (IBMBIO.SYS in PC-DOS).



      MSDOS.SYS contains the code to handle DOS low-level function calls,

      including INT 21h services (IBMDOS.SYS in PC-DOS).



      The files are loaded into memory and control passes to IO.SYS.



   3) IO.SYS looks for DBLSPACE.BIN in the root of the boot disk.  If

      found, it is loaded into the upper part of conventional<a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/NOTHERE.HTM">^</a> memory.



      DBLSPACE.BIN intercepts all disk I/O services.  When it initializes,

      it looks for <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/NOTHERE.HTM">DBLSPACE.INI</a> (also in the root) and using information it

      contains, it may swap one or more drive IDs.



      If either DBLSPACE.BIN or DBLSPACE.INI is not found, then <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/NOTHERE.HTM">DoubleSpace</a>

      support will not be present.



      Note:    With DOS 6.2+, you can bypass this early load of

      DBLSPACE.BIN by pressing Ctrl+F5 when you boot.



   4) IO.SYS displays:



           Starting MS-DOS...



      It then looks for a text file<a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/NOTHERE.HTM">^</a> named <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0267.HTM">CONFIG.SYS</a> in the root of the

      boot disk.  If found, it is read and processed as a series of

      configuration commands.  If SWITCHES=/F is not found, there is a

      2-second delay.  In this interval, you can press F5 (see <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0269.HTM">Clean Boot</a>)

      or F8 (see <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0270.HTM">Interactive Boot</a>) to control the rest of the boot

      sequence.



      Note that when DoubleSpace is active, DBLSPACE.BIN has already

      intercepted disk I/O calls (and swapped drive C), so IO.SYS will find

      CONFIG.SYS on the compressed volume.



   5) If CONFIG.SYS contains a <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0271.HTM">MultiConfig menu</a>, then the menu is

      displayed:

          MS-DOS 6 Startup Menu

          ���������������������

          1. option

          2. option

          ... etc. ...



          Enter a choice: _



      It prompts for user input.  The <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0288.HTM">MENUDEFAULT=</a> command can specify a

      time-out value to continue the boot without waiting for a keystroke.



      The <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/NOTHERE.HTM">CONFIG</a> e-var is set to match the option chosen.



   6) IO.SYS executes all commands in <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0271.HTM">[COMMON]</a> sections (including the

      "implied [COMMON]" area before the first section or the <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0271.HTM">[MENU]</a> line).

      It then proceeds to execute the particular commands specified in the

      selected (or default) section.



      Note that IO.SYS does not necessarily run commands in the order they

      appear in CONFIG.SYS.  It internally reorders commands into groups

      and then executes the groups in this order:

    

      � DOS=, SWITCHES=, SET etc. general configuration commands.

    

      � DEVICE= and DEVICEHIGH= <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0298.HTM">device driver</a> installation commands.

        Note that drive letters are assigned according to the order in

        which the device drivers are loaded in CONFIG.SYS.

    

      � INSTALL= and INSTALLHIGH= TSR installation commands.



      MultiConfig menu sections cannot override this general order; for

      instance, you can't run an <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0283.HTM">INSTALL=</a> line before a <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0276.HTM">DEVICE=</a> line.



   7) If a <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0292.HTM">SHELL=</a> command appears in CONFIG.SYS, then the program it

      identifies will be used as the DOS command processor.  If not, then

      the file COMMAND.COM will be used.  IO.SYS will look for COMMAND.COM

      in the root of the boot disk, and if not found, it will search \DOS

      and \MSDOS.



      IO.SYS sets the <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/NOTHERE.HTM">COMSPEC</a> e-var to identify the command processor.



   8) COMMAND.COM initially sets up a minimal <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/NOTHERE.HTM">DOS environment</a> containing a

      simple path (PATH=C:\DOS) and a standard prompt (PROMPT=$p$g).



   9) By default, COMMAND.COM looks for a text file<a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/NOTHERE.HTM">^</a> named AUTOEXEC.BAT in

      the root of the boot disk and begins executing the commands it

      contains.



    Note: with DOS 6.0+, You can force COMMAND.COM to execute a different

          startup batch by using <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/0292.HTM">SHELL=</a>d:\path\command.com /K=batfile.bat

          in CONFIG.SYS.



 AUTOEXEC.BAT can be tailored to execute a different set of commands for

 each of the MultiConfig menu options by testing the <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/danrollins/techhelp/NOTHERE.HTM">CONFIG</a> e-var.



 Finally, the command processor displays the command prompt and you may

 begin interactive computing.
